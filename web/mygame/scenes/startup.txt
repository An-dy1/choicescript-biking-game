Welcome to a choose your own Kansas City biking adventure game!

This game is boring: your task is to get to work. Sounds simple, right?

You wake up - a bad dream startled you. You blink. It's…light out side.

Shit!

You look at the time - it's 7 a.m. You were supposed to be awake 30 minutes ago. And of all days, of course you forgot to set an alarm on the day of the big pitch.

You grab your phone and the first thing you check is the weather.

Oh, great. You see that today it's going to be ${weather}.

You'd planned on having enough time this morning to take your time: do some sun salutations; play Wordle; and French press your coffee. You'll have to skip all that and just get dressed instead.

Still groggy, you pull open your closet and start to weigh your options. You push aside the cold weather biking gear
and are left with just a couple of options.

*page_break
The easiest choice: just wear your work clothes. The marketing agency you work for, BBGCY, is casual. You can get away with a light shirt and some utility pants. It'll save you some time on the commute, it's comfortable, and you won't have to change at work.

On the other hand: you could pull on your high vis get-up. You've got a t-shirt in construction-worker orange and some biking shorts with reflectors on it. It'll be daylight soon, but who knows when you might be biking home tonight…

The easiest choice: throw your rain jacket over your work clothes. The marketing agency you work for, BBGCY, is casual. You can get away with a comfortable long-sleeved shirt and some utility pants. It'll save you some time on the commute, it's comfortable, and you won't have to change at work. Plus, it's a fashionable rain jacket. But, it's black, so it might be harder to see today.

On the other hand: your mother got you a high-vis construction worker's get-up for Christmas. It's heavy duty and will definitely be visible today. But, it's bulky and awkward, and you're already running a little late…

*comment   #Make pre-emptive war on the western lands.
*comment     If you can seize their territory, your kingdom will flourish.  But your army's
*comment     morale is low and the kingdom's armory is empty.  How will you win the war?
*comment     *choice
*comment       #Drive the peasants like slaves; if we work hard enough, we'll win.
*comment         Unfortunately, morale doesn't work like that.  Your army soon turns against you
*comment         and the kingdom falls to the western barbarians.
*comment         *finish
*comment       #Appoint charismatic knights and give them land, peasants, and resources.
*comment         Your majesty's people are eminently resourceful.  Your knights win the day,
*comment         but take care: they may soon demand a convention of parliament.
*comment         *finish
*comment       #Steal food and weapons from the enemy in the dead of night.
*comment         A cunning plan.  Soon your army is a match for the westerners; they choose
*comment         not to invade for now, but how long can your majesty postpone the inevitable?
*comment         *finish
*comment   #Beat swords to plowshares and trade food to the westerners for protection.
*comment     The westerners have you at the point of a sword.  They demand unfair terms
*comment     from you.
*comment     *choice
*comment       #Accept the terms for now.
*comment         Eventually, the barbarian westerners conquer you anyway, destroying their
*comment         bread basket, and the entire region starves.
*comment         *finish
*comment       #Threaten to salt our fields if they don't offer better terms.
*comment         They blink.  Your majesty gets a fair price for wheat.
*comment         *finish
*comment   #Abdicate the throne. I have clearly mismanaged this kingdom!
*comment     The kingdom descends into chaos, but you manage to escape with your own hide.
*comment     Perhaps in time you can return to restore order to this fair land.
